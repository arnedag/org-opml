* org-opml

=ox-opml.el= exports Org mode files to OPML.

For example, [[http://files.davising.com/2014/03/01/nba.org][here]] is an Org file listing every NBA team, organized by
conference and division and [[http://files.davising.com/2014/03/01/nba.opml][here]] is that same file after being
exported.

Built using Org mode's builtin [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Exporting][export functionality]], the goal of this
backend is to allow you to write structured documents in Org that can
easily be exported to OPML.

** Features

- Handles headlines, plain list items, and paragraphs
- HTML entities (<, >, &, etc.) are safely escaped
- Can set =<outline>= attributes via property drawers
- Uses standard [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Export-settings][export settings]] in the =<head>= element
- Follows the OPML 2.0 [[http://dev.opml.org/spec2.html][specification]]

** Installation

1) Copy =ox-opml.el= into =load-path=
2) Evaluate =(load-library "ox-opml")=

** Usage

1) While visiting an Org file, press =\C-c \C-e= to open the [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#The-Export-Dispatcher][Export Dispatcher]]
2) Press =o= to activate the OPML exporter
3) The exported file will be created in the same directory as the Org
   file with an ".opml" extension
