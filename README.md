`ox-opml.el` exports OPML files from Org mode.

For example, <a
href="http://files.davising.com/2014/03/01/nba.org">here</a> is an Org
mode file listing every NBA team, organized by conference and division
and <a href="http://files.davising.com/2014/03/01/nba.opml">here</a>
is that same file after being exported.
